Grid

Created a simple application that calculated the max product of 4 numbers that are touching (row, column, diagonal) given a grid.

How it works:
1. A grid, at least 4 by 4, a text file is opened and read
2. Product of 4 adjacent numbers, regardless of direction, is calculated, and the max product is returned
3. Max product of the grid is printed out
