BabyNames

A program that creates a Baby Directory from a text file, which contains the most popular baby names of each decade from 1900 to 2000 (inclusive) in the US. From there, an user can query the directory in 6 different methods. 

Included in the program are try and catch blocks to catch any human error.

How it works:
1. You will be prompted for a textfile that contains the baby name information. One if provided for you.
2. Once entering the file name, the directory will be created and populated
3. You will be shown a prompt of 7 things you can do (where 7 is to quit the program). Insert a # from 1-7 (inclusive) to query the baby data in different ways.
