DNA

Given two sequences of DNA, trying to find the longest common sequence, aka substring.

How it works:
1. It will read a file called "dna.txt". The text file will have a number in the first line, representing the # of DNA pairs to look at. Then the following lines will have the DNA sequences.
2. The longest common sequences will be printed out. If none, then "No Common Sequence Found" will be printed.
