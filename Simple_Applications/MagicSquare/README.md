MagicSquare

Created a program that takes in an odd number, greater than 1. Then, creates a n by n grid, populated by numbers from 1 to n^2 in a way that each row, column, diagonal summation is equal to the canonical sum, which is given by n*(n^2+1)/2.

How it works:
1. Input an odd number, greater than 1
2. The program will create a n by n grid, a magic square, then calculate the summation of the row, column, and diagonals to see if they equal the canonical sum.
3. If summations check out, then a message will be returned announcing that the grid is a magic square and what the canonical sum is.
4. If summations do not, then a message will be returned saying the grid is not a magic square.
