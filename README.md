# Csharp_dotnet
Journey of Csharp and .NET development

This folder contains my development of C# and .NET

Current Folders:
1. Application_Projects - folder that contains more substantial and bigger applications (e.g. multiple files, classes, etc.)
2. FundamentalsofCSharp - folder that contains basic programs that helped with adjusting to C#/.NET
3. Simple_Applications - folder that contains simple applications. Usually all code will be under Program.cs

As time goes by, this folder will evolve.
