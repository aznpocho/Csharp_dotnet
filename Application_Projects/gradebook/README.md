gradebook

Created an application that imitates a simple gradebook. Incorporates key OOP principles (inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, encapsulation) and other important C# concepts.

How it works:
1. A prompt will ask to enter a grade or press 'q' to quit
2. Enter grade, can be numerical (0-100, inclusive) or char (A, B, C). Try and catch and Exception clauses are placed to catch any erroneous inputs
3. Keep adding grades, until ready to quit. After quitting, simple statistics about the grades in the gradebook will be displayed, then the program will be closed out.
